I'm a master's student at the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. [Xiu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xrh1OIUAAAAJ). I received my bachelor's degree from Department of Automation at Tsinghua University in 2019. My research interests lie in deep reinforcement learning (RL), especially goal-conditioned RL, offline RL and model-based RL. I'm also interested in the application of RL algorithms to game AI and robotics.

I was furtunate to visit the Machine Intelligence Group of Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) at Tsinghua University, working with Prof. [Chongjie Zhang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zhang/). Before that, I was a student intern at Tencent Robotics X Lab (mentored by Prof. [Meng Fang](https://mengf1.github.io) and Dr. [Lei Han](http://www.leihan.org)) and Tencent AI Lab (mentored by [Lanqing Li](https://lanqingli1993.github.io)).

Experiences

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

During my leisure time, I like sports such as running, table tennis, swimming. I used to be an amateur long-distance runner with my personal bests:

|  Distance    | Time     |
| ---------- | :-----------:  | 
|  3 km    | 10min 28s     |
|   5 km   | 18min 28s     | 
|   21.0975 km (half marathon)  | 1h 30min      | 
|  42.195 km  (marathon) | 3h 36min     |
