I am a CS PhD student at UIUC, advised by Prof. [Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org) and Prof. [Huan Zhang](https://www.huan-zhang.com). Previously, I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees from the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University and CSE, HKUST. Currently, my research focuses on: **Agents**, **Trustworthy LLMs/VLMs**, and **Deep reinforcement learning**.

Prior to my PhD, I am fortunate to have been working closely with Prof. [Chongjie Zhang](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Chongjie-Zhang.html) (Washington University in St. Louis), Dr. [Lei Han](http://www.leihan.org) (Tencent AI Lab), and Prof. [Meng Fang](https://mengfn.github.io) (University of Liverpool).

## Hobbies

In my leisure time, I enjoy sports like running, table tennis, and swimming. During my time at Tsinghua University, I was an amateur long-distance runner. In 2019, I completed a half marathon (21.0975 km) in 1 h 30 m and a full marathon (42.195 km) in 3 h 36 m.
