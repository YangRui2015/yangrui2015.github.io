I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UIUC, advised by Prof. [Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org) and Prof. [Huan Zhang](https://www.huan-zhang.com). Previously, I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees from the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University and CSE, HKUST. My current research interests lie in **Foundation Models for Agents**, **Trustworthy LLMs/VLMs**, and **Deep Reinforcement Learning**. My long-term goal is to develop **agent foundation models with strong perception, reasoning, and planning capabilities**, enabling scalable and reliable autonomous systems.


Prior to my PhD, I was fortunate to work closely with Prof. [Chongjie Zhang](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Chongjie-Zhang.html) (Washington University in St. Louis), Dr. [Lei Han](http://www.leihan.org) (Noitom Robotics, formerly Tencent AI Lab), and Prof. [Meng Fang](https://mengfn.github.io) (University of Liverpool).

## Hobbies {#others}

In my leisure time, I enjoy sports like running, table tennis, and swimming. During my time at Tsinghua University, I was an amateur long-distance runner. In 2019, I completed a half marathon (21.0975 km) in 1 h 30 min and a full marathon (42.195 km) in 3 h 36 min. However, since starting my PhD I haven’t had time for regular running training, so I’ve let it slide. Hopefully I’ll get a chance to update my record once I graduate🙂.
