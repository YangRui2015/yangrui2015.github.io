I'm a first year Ph.D. student at CSE, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. [Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org). I received my master's degree and bachelor's degree from the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University. My research interests lie in deep reinforcement learning (RL), especially goal-conditioned RL, offline RL and model-based RL. I'm also interested in the application of RL algorithms to game AI and robotics.

I was furtunate to visit the Machine Intelligence Group of Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) at Tsinghua University, working with Prof. [Chongjie Zhang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zhang/). Before that, I was a student intern at Tencent Robotics X Lab (mentored by Prof. [Meng Fang](https://mengf1.github.io) and Dr. [Lei Han](http://www.leihan.org)) and Tencent AI Lab (mentored by [Lanqing Li](https://lanqingli1993.github.io)).

During my leisure time, I like sports such as running, table tennis and swimming. I used to be an amateur long-distance runner. I finished a half marathon (21.0975 km) in 1h30min and a marathon (42.195 km) in 3h36min.
